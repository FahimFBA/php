I think the first thing that might come into your mind is that "Isn't PHP already dead?" Trust me, I was thinking the same thing when I started learning this language.

## Introduction (What is PHP?)

PHP is actually an abbreviation or acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor". It is an open-source scripting language and it is still used widely. Let me tell you about some widely popular websites that use PHP, and it will simply blow your mind thinking that how many popular websites are still using it!

[Facebook](https://facebook.com/), [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), [Tumbler](https://www.tumblr.com/), [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/), [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/), and even [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) use PHP! I guess you are also overwhelmed by PHP after getting to know that even these big websites use PHP as a programming language.

## Installation

For this book, I am going to use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) for showing you everything in PHP.  I am not going to take more time here as the installation process is very similar to other normal software. Simply download the latest version of XAMPP for your operating system and install it afterward.  

If you do not change the installation directory of XAMPP during the installation process, then XAMPP will create the installation folder under the `C:` drive. Simply go to your **C** drive and search for a folder named "xampp".

<figcaption align = "center"><b>The necessary directory of XAMPP in C Drive</b></figcaption>
</figure>

Inside the directory, you will get a bunch of folders and files like below.

<figcaption align = "center"><b>A lot of files and folders inside the "xampp" folder, but we do not need to worry about these for now!</b></figcaption>
</figure>

We will go into the "**htdocs**" folder.

<figure>
<img src="img/3.png" alt="htdocs folder" style="width:100%">
<figcaption align = "center"><b>"htdocs" folder</b></figcaption>
</figure>

We will see some more folders and files inside the "htdocs" folder.

<figure>
<img src="img/4.png" alt="inside htdocs folder" style="width:100%">
<figcaption align = "center"><b>Folders and Files inside the "htdocs" folder</b></figcaption>
</figure>

We will create a new folder here where we will practice our PHP scripts. For this article, let's say that I am going to use a new folder named "PHPwithFahim". You can name it whatever you want, but make sure not to start the name other than any alphabet, and also do not keep any space between words/characters in the folder name. 


<figure>
<img src="img/5.png" alt="PHPwithFahim Folder" style="width:100%">
<figcaption align = "center"><b>Folder "PHPwithFahim"</b></figcaption>
</figure>

Now open this folder in your Sublime Text. Simply click on "File" and click on "Open Folder...".

<figure>
<img src="img/6.png" alt="Sublime Text" style="width:100%">
<figcaption align = "center"><b>Open Folder in Sublime Text</b></figcaption>
</figure>

Select the "PHPwithFahim" folder and open it in Sublime Text.

<figure>
<img src="img/7.png" alt="interface of Sublime text" style="width:100%">
<figcaption align = "center"><b></b></figcaption>
</figure>

Now, create a file "index.php", and save it to "PHPwithFahim" folder. 

<figure>
<img src="img/8.png" alt="index.php" style="width:100%">
<figcaption align = "center"><b>Create "index.php"</b></figcaption>
</figure>

About the extension, all PHP file has `.php` extensions in them. Therefore, we need to provide the `.php` extension anytime we want to create any PHP file. I will code in VS Code and I will check the output in my browser window.

For the browser, I always prefer the widely popular [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser, but you can use other browsers.

### Change Compatibility (Optional)

I always change the compatibility for two files. I often get many notifications during shutting down XAMPP on Windows. But it is completely an optional task. You do not necessarily need to follow this part if you do not want to tweak these. 

I need to change something more inside the "xampp" folder. Inside the root folder of "xampp", we need to change the compatibility. 

<figure>
<img src="img/10.png" style="width:100%">
<figcaption align = "center"><b></b></figcaption>
</figure>

Right click on "xampp_stop.exe" and go to properties. 

<figure>
<img src="img/11.png" style="width:50%">
<figcaption align = "center"><b></b></figcaption>
</figure>

Go to the "Compatibility" tab. Make sure to check the box beside "Run this program as an administrator". Then click Apply and OK.

<figure>
<img src="img/12.png" style="width:50%">
<figcaption align = "center"><b></b></figcaption>
</figure>

You have to do the same thing for "xampp-control.exe" file as well.

## Start `XAMPP`

Before writing any PHP code, make sure to open XAMPP, and Start the `Apache` and `MySQL` modules. Simply click "Start".

<figure>
<img src="img/13.png" style="width:100%">
<figcaption align = "center"><b></b></figcaption>
</figure>

It will start `Apache` and `MySQL`. Now we are good to go!

<figure>
<img src="img/14.png" style="width:100%">
<figcaption align = "center"><b></b></figcaption>
</figure>

Open the browser and go to `localhost/PHPwithFahim`. It will redirect you to `http://localhost/PHPwithFahim/` automatically every time. Make sure to replace `PHPwithFahim` with the folder name that you are going to use for yourself. 

<figure>
<img src="img/15.png" style="width:100%">
<figcaption align = "center"><b></b></figcaption>
</figure>

Of course, it is currently empty, because we have not written anything to our `index.php` file to display here. 

Now you can start your PHP learning journey!

## Hello World in PHP

Sublime text automatically comes with PHP auto-completion features. Simply type `php` and press the `Tab` key. It will automatically provide the boilerplate for your PHP file.

<figure>
<img src="img/16.png" style="width:100%">
<figcaption align = "center"><b></b></figcaption>
</figure>

For printing something, we use `echo`.

For example, as we want to print `Hello World`, we can write `echo "Hello World"` inside the boilerplate`. The code would be like this: 

```php
<?php 
echo "Hello World";	
?>
```

Now, we need to save the file before checking the output. I like to use the shortcut keys, `Ctrl` + `S` to save files.

Now, I can check the output in my browser window. For this, I need to go to `localhost/PHPwithFahim`.

<figure>
<img src="img/17.png" style="width:100%">
<figcaption align = "center"><b></b></figcaption>
</figure>

Please keep in mind, that the font size will not be this much bigger. I zoomed on the browser window before taking the screenshot.

For the rest of the repository, I am not going to use any images as that might create more distraction. But don't worry, as I will obviously state all the inputs and outputs sequentially.

Whenever we want to print something using the `echo`, we need to use single quote or the double quote to specify the whole strings.

Yes, that means, we can also use the single quote instead of the double qoutes if we want. For example, check the below code:

```php
<?php 
echo 'Hello World';	
?>
```

This code also provides the same output as earlier.

```
Hello World
```
But you have to be careful about mixing them, as the mixing of the single and the double quotes will not work!

```php
<?php 
echo "Hello World';	
?>
```
This gives the following error in the browser window as we used the double qoute `"` and th single quote `'` together in a same string.

```
Parse error: syntax error, unexpected end of file, expecting variable or "${" or "{$" in C:\xampp\htdocs\PHPwithFahim\index.php on line 3
```

```php
<?php 
echo 'Hello World";	
?>
```

This also gives error as we again used the single quote and the double quote together in a same string.

```
Parse error: syntax error, unexpected string content "Hello World"; " in C:\xampp\htdocs\PHPwithFahim\index.php on line 2
```
