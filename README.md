I think the first thing that might come into your mind is that "Isn't PHP already dead?" Trust me, I was thinking the same thing when I started learning this language.

## Introduction (What is PHP?)

PHP is actually an abbreviation or acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor". It is an open-source scripting language and it is still used widely. Let me tell you about some widely popular websites that use PHP, and it will simply blow your mind thinking that how many popular websites are still using it!

[Facebook](https://facebook.com/), [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), [Tumbler](https://www.tumblr.com/), [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/), [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/), and even [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) use PHP! I guess you are also overwhelmed by PHP after getting to know that even these big websites use PHP as a programming language.


## Installation

For this book, I am going to use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) for showing you everything in PHP.  I am not going to take more time here as the installation process is very similar to other normal software. Simply download the latest version of XAMPP for your operating system and install it afterward.  

If you do not change the installation directory of XAMPP during the installation process, then XAMPP will create the installation folder under the `C:` drive. Simply go to your **C** drive and search for a folder named "xampp".

Inside the directory, you will get a bunch of folders and files like below.

We will go into the "**htdocs**" folder.

We will see some more folders and files inside the "htdocs" folder.
